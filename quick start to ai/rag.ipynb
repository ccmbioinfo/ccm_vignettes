    "Rag stands for *Retrieval Augmented Generation* the idea is to provide the LLM with some context to aid it generate better results. There are many ways one can set up rag. There are a lot of commercial and semi-commercial tools one can use. We will explore some basic elements of RAG and generate some of the componenets. We will **not** generate a fully functioning RAG as there are many componenets to it and we might not have time. I will introduce some of the tools that one can use while building a rag system. \n",

    "## Knowledge Base\n",
    "\n",
    "This is very context dependent, but basically something you curate before you even think about building a RAG. I would think that it's the other way around that is you will have a knowledge base already and you thinkg RAG would be a good way to use it. \n",

    "There are couple of things we would need to do make sure that our knowledge base is useful. \n",

    "1. Process the documents this involves:\n",
    "    +  Getting the documents in a format that is machine readable,\n",
    "    +  Chunking large documents into smaller bits and pieces so we do not run out of context length\n",
    "    +  embedding the text, (we will need to pick an embedding model that is suitable for this task)\n",
    "    +  Store it in a place that is searchable"

There are a few different kinds of datasets, I will just be using the business one since it is smaller and quicker to load. "

       "['The only reason I didn\\'t give this restaurant a 5 star rating, is because of one single pretentious waiter. As a 4 night guest at Hotel Palomar, the location of the restaurant is an obvious plus. The first night of my stay, I met a coworker in the restaurant for a cocktail. When we arrived, the host staff were busy and not available, so we just walked in. The restaurant was not too busy, so we just looked at a small table next to the bar and proceeded to take a seat. A waiter came by and I quickly asked if we could have a seat, before sitting down and told him we\\'d only be having cocktails. He stumbled on his reply, and in an irritated/in-convinced tone, told me \"I guess it would be fine\" and basically just kept walking mid sentence. My guest and I brushed it off, and started having a conversation while looking at the drink menu. To make a long story short, he was distant and we both got the \"couldn\\'t be bothered\" vibe from him. When it came to the bill, we asked if it could be split due to company transaction policies, and you would have thought asked him for some inconceivable task. We basically spent the rest of our night and elevator ride to our room in shock of the rudeness we had just experienced.',\n",
       " 'Although that situation left a bad taste in our mouth, and the night before we decided to avoid the restaurant, we decided to grab another cocktail and give this place one more try. After looking around and ensuring \"last nights waiter\" wasn\\'t on shift, we walked over to the bar and started looking over the menu. Instantly, the bartender greeted us with pleasant small talk and made us feel 100% welcome. He asked about our day, recommended cocktails and was a completely genuine person. This guy (I think his name was Ben) is an absolute star! He gave us lessons on Whiskey, described how to make classic cocktails, and was 100% invested in our experience. This is exactly what a bartender at a 4/5 star establishment should be - actually he exceeds that. He was kind, funny, friendly and completely redeemed this restaurant/bar from our terrible experience the night before. \\nI also ordered room service last night from this restaurant, and it was amazing. The bacon wrapped dates and chocolate cake are to die for! Great restaurant and amazing bartender(s). Too bad one bad egg could have spoiled this experience.']"

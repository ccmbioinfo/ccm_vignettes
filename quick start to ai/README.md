# Quick Start to AI

This set of python notebooks will provide you with a primer to get started on various AI processes.

This is not a theoretical introduction to the subject but how to get started quickly using existing tools and models 
from opensource repositories. In this instance we will be focusing on [huggingface](huggingface.co). 

Huggingface and their python packages (transformers et.al.) provide a quick an easy way to start working with AI models. 
They have excellent documentaion and a robus ecosystem to get you started. 

In these series of annotated notebooks we will not be performing an kind of biological analysis but rather we will 
focus on different kinds of things you can build. These include

+ Quick start to huggingface
+ Vision transformers (huggingface for images)
+ Fine tuning models and training from scratch
+ Usuing parameter efficient fine tuning (PEFT)
+ Quantization to save memory with minimal sacrifices to performance
+ Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) for better performance w/o any training
+ Agents (let them loose)

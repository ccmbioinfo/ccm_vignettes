# Introduction To Python

Here we have a two parter introduction to python. 

In [part 1](./introduction&#32;to&#32;python/python_bootcamp_p1.ipynb) you can find:

+ Variables
+ Basic data types and associated methods
+ List, Dictionaries, Sets, Tuples
+ Loops, iteration, comprehension
+ logical statements
+ functions, generators, decorators
+ exception handling
+ quick introduction to OOP (object oriented programming)
+ class inheritance

decorator, OOP and class inheritance are relatively advanced features so don't worry if they feel confusing
at first.

+ Built in and third party modules
+ Pandas Introduction

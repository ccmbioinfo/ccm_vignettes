## Here you can find a in depth primer on getting started with RNA sequencing data and analysis.

You can find the detailed vignette [here](/RNA-Seq/RNA-Seq.md). It will go into pre experiment (i.e. library prep, file formats and genomes), into aligning and counting reads and then into statistical analyses to assess differential gene expression.

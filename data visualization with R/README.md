# R visualization

Here you can find resources and vignettes to aid with data visualization in R using the ggplot2 and pheatmap plotting libraries.

The main script is [plotting.R](./plotting.R) which includes commented code for how to use ggplot and pheatmap with both sample data (found [here](./r-sample-data.txt)) and built in datasets that R provides.

There are also generated cheatsheets for both [ggplot](./data-visualization.pdf) and base [R](./r-cheat-sheet.pdf).

To prepare for these tutorials/vignettes:
+ Install the latest version of R from CRAN [https://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/)
+ Have the RStudio software pre-installed from [https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download)
+ Install packages ggplot2, dplyr, patchwork, pheatmap and viridis (optional) using the command `install.packages(c("ggplot2", "patchwork", "pheatmap", "dplyr", "pheatmap"))`
+ Create a folder in your computer and download the `r-sample-data.txt` to that location.

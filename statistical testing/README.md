# Intro to Statistical Testing

These files include a [powerpoint](./statistical&#32;testing/Introduction_to_statistical_testing.pptx) to serve as a primer into what is statistical testing and how you can get started, as well as some examples with R code that you can find [here](./statistical&#32;testing/statistical_testing.R).


The statistical_testing.R file goes over how to perform some of the tests that are described in the ppt file. These are
meant to provide a starting point and is in no shape or form an exhaustive collection of all statistical tests.
